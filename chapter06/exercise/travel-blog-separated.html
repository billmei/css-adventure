      <h2>Our trip to Killarney</h2>
      <p>We took a road trip to Killarney, which is a provincial park in Ontario, Canada. We hung out at the beach, went canoeing around the islands, and did some hiking up to the lookout point where you could see all the lakes in the area.</p>
      <p>It was a relaxing weekend for us and I enjoyed spending some time off to soak in the sounds and smells of nature. I can't wait to go back sometime!</p>

      <h2>Our trip to Paris</h2>
      <p>We stayed with a friend in Paris who was studying there. She told us all about French culture and the wonderful people she met in the city.</p>
      <p>We went to see the Eiffel Tower and took some photos on the observation deck. The Eiffel Tower was so much taller in person than it looks in photos! Afterwards, we hung out at a bar and chatted over food and drinks.</p>

      <h2>My trip to the Grand Canyon</h2>
      <p>I went camping at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The views were incredible; I've never seen such a big canyon before in my life.</p>
      <p>The North Rim is quieter and less crowded than the South Rim. One day in the future, I want to come back to cross the entire canyon from one rim to the other.</p>
