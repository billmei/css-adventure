  <p>Call me <em class="changed-brick">Ishmael</em>. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would <em class="changed-brick">sail</em> about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>
