        <p>Hey, I'm <a href="https://billmei.net" class="rainbow-text">Bill Mei</a>. For years, I've been consulting for software startups to help them ship beautiful web design.</p>
        <p>However, I got tired of seeing people make the same mistakes with CSS over and over again. So I'm writing a book to teach <em>everyone</em> (developers <em>and</em> designers!) how to write maintainable, easy-to-understand CSS that is a joy to work with.</p>

        <h3>Do you feel like this when you write CSS?</h3>
        <p><img src="/images/peter-griffin-css-blinds.gif" alt="Peter Griffin struggling with blinds" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" /></p>

        <p>You're not alone.</p>

        <p>Imagine how it would feel if you could make CSS do what you want without the frustration:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>You could approach CSS with confidence instead of with a sense of dread</p></li>
          <li><p>You could fix visual bugs uncovered by your product manager in record time, allowing you to go home early and avoid spending all evening trying to get that text to stop overflowing, damnit.</p></li>
          <li><p>The next time your company proposes a redesign, you could volunteer to take the lead on the project, allowing you to stand out from your colleagues and win over your boss (this was the exact tactic I used to get a promotion at my last employer)</p></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- TODO: Add a CTA here. My book <em>Learn to be good at CSS</em> will give you the tools to master CSS and write it with confidence: -->

        <h3>It's not your fault if you haven't yet learned the easy way to write CSS</h3>

        <p>They never told you in your university CS classes (or at your bootcamp course) how important CSS is when you started working at a real job delivering real products. As a result, you're pressured to ship CSS at your work where you don't have time to learn the fundamentals.</p>

        <p>Worse, the existing CSS resources out there are very technical and assume you already know how browser C++ rendering engines work, which is not at all approachable.</p>

        <p>Because there is no good resource that gives you a solid mental model for how CSS actually works from the ground up, you're left copy/pasting stuff from Stackoverflow and hoping it works. No wonder it feels so frustrating to debug those exotic display issues.</p>


        <h3>If only you had a good resource to learn from, writing CSS could feel like this instead:</h3>

        <!-- <p><img src="/images/painting-fast.gif" alt="An artist painting a cityscape extremely quickly" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" /></p> -->
  
        <!-- TODO: Add mp4 as primary, and .gif as fallback. Same with peter griffin gif-->

        <p>The book I'm writing will teach you CSS from first principles, giving you the best mental models to think about CSS, so you have a strong foundation to figure out how to solve web design problems on your own without having to resort to brute trial and error.</p>
        <p>It's important to me that the book explains things in a clear, jargon-free way. I'm spending time painstakingly editing and user testing it to make sure it's as fun to read as it is informative, so I can give you the confidence to use CSS to design anything that you can dream of.</p>
