        Do you feel like this whenever you're asked to touch CSS?

        Imagine how it would feel if you could make CSS do what you want without stress:

        By being good at CSS, it helped me stand out and take leadership on a project for design systems.

        What is CSS? It's the code you write that gives a website its styling. Click here to see what this website would look like without CSS.

                <h2>Who are you and why should I learn CSS from you?</h2>
                <p>Hey, I'm <a href="https://billmei.net">Bill Mei</a>. I've been a software consultant for years helping companies deliver beautiful web design and got tired of seeing people make the same mistakes with CSS repeatedly. So I'm writing a book to teach <em>everyone</em> (yes, including you, if you don't know how to code!) how to write maintainable, easy-to-understand CSS that is a joy to work with.</p>
                <p>Too often, people are frustrated when they write CSS because it feels like this:</p>
                
                <p>This is because there is no good comprehensive resource that gives you a good mental model for how CSS actually works from the ground up, so you're left copy/pasting stuff from Stackoverflow and hoping it works.</p>
                <p>Worse, the official documentation is very technical and assumes you already know how browser C++ rendering engines work, which is not approachable for designers, product people, or others who want to work with CSS but don't know how to code.</p>
                <p>The book I'm writing will be that comprehensive resource that explains things in a clear, jargon-free way which will give you a solid foundation for understanding how CSS actually works, and give you the confidence to use CSS to design anything that you can dream of.</p>
                <h2>Will this book help me stand out to my boss and get me a promotion?</h2>
                <p>Sure.</p>
                <p>Normally, I'd write more here to try to convince you to buy the book but I'm focusing my time writing the actual book instead of the marketing page. Instead, I've included an irrelevant stock photo of a baby deer.</p>
